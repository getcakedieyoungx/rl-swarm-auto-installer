## 🚀 Features

*   **🎨 ASCII Art:** Because style matters.
*   **📦 Auto-Dependencies:** Installs Python, Node.js, Yarn, and system tools automatically.
*   **🚇 Smart Tunneling:** Sets up `localtunnel` in the background and gives you the URL/Password instantly.
*   **🛡️ Safety First:** Detach instructions included to keep your node running 24/7.

## 🛠️ Installation

You can set up your node in less than 1 minute.

### Option 1: The "Lazy" Way (One Command)
*(Coming soon once pushed to main)*

### Option 2: Manual Clone

## 📋 What Happens Next?

1.  The script will update your system and install necessary tools.
2.  It will start a **Tunnel** and show you a URL (e.g., `https://funny-cat-42.loca.lt`).
3.  **IMPORTANT:** It will show a Password (your IP). **Save this!**
4.  It will launch the Gensyn Swarm.
5.  When you see the logs, press `CTRL + A` then `D` to detach safely.
