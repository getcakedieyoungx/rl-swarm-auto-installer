## 🛠️ Installation

You can set up your node in less than 1 minute.

### Option 1: The "Lazy" Way (One Command)

Just copy and paste this into your terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getcakedieyoungx/rl-swarm-auto-installer/main/install_gensyn.sh)
```

### Option 2: Manual Clone

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/getcakedieyoungx/gensyn-installer.git
    cd gensyn-installer
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x install_gensyn.sh
    ```

3.  **Run it:**
    ```bash
    ./install_gensyn.sh
    ```

## 📋 What Happens Next?

1.  The script will update your system and install necessary tools.
2.  It will start a **Tunnel** and show you a URL (e.g., `https://funny-cat-42.loca.lt`).
3.  **IMPORTANT:** It will show a Password (your IP). **Save this!**
4.  It will launch the Gensyn Swarm.
5.  When you see the logs, press `CTRL + A` then `D` to detach safely.
